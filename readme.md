# Central Limit Theorem
According to the central limit theorem, as long as the sample size is large enough,
the sampling distribution of the mean will always be Gaussian,
Regardless of the population distribution.
The assignment consists of a Python script that generates a random sample collection 
N1 from a uniform distribution and calculates its mean. This process is repeated N2 times
to obtain a sampling distribution of the mean. 
Also, we can see as number of samples increase, the width of distribution decrease.
